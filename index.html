        <h2 id="about">About this Project</h2>
        <p id="blerb">
            This website was built as the precurser to a knitting app for a coding project.<br /><br />
            Inspiration came when I was trying to adjust a baby blanket pattern that called for 4 weight but
            I was using 3 weight. I wanted to keep the same size but knew with a thinner yarn, I would need
            to cast on more stitches/loops to accomadate the difference. But by how much?<br /><br />
            With this app a user will need to set the yarn weight a pattern calls for, what yarn weight they
            are using, and the program will calculate the number of stitches they will need to add or subtract
            to keep the same pattern.

            <p>
                If you were to do a quick search on trends or needs in the technology field,
                it would be hard to miss ones like this: <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/state-of-women-in-tech/">The State of Women in Tech in 2019</a>
                that talk about the need for diversity, specifically women, in technology jobs.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I love to read about is how specific women became intrested in and then
                sought a career in technology. It's much easier to do with the advancment of personal
                devices like cell phones and tablets. For me, my interest began when I was younger with
                peronalized blogs like MySpace and LiveJournal. Today, my drive is through my hobbies of
                sewing and knititing. I was inspired by software programs like <a href="https://www.patternmakerusa.com/">Pattern Maker</a>
                for pattern drafting and <a href="http://www.envisioknit.com/">EnvisonKnit</a>),
                to map out self made knitting patterns. Through this app I hope it will also be a
                valuable tool for crafters and inspire others with an interest in technology
                use their hobbies/interets to get there in creative ways.

        <h3 class="gloves">Fingerless Gloves</h3>
        <p id="gloves paragraph">
            The first project was a pair of fingerless gloves, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fishtail-wristwarmers">
                Fishtail Wristwarmers
            </a>, that called for yarn weight fingering (2) and needles sized 2.
            The yarn I choose was <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/loops--threads-woolike">
                Loops & Threads Woolike
            </a> that has a weight of light fingering, aka lace. While I did not adjust
            the pattern for the first glove, I did make stitch adjustments to the second. However, this began
            my curiosity to determine a set method or resource that would help me adjust patterns based
            on yarn weight and needle size.

        <h3 class="blanket">Baby Blanket</h3>
        <p id="blanket paragraph">
            The second project that I had to considered how to adjust the pattern to fit the needle size
            was <a href="https://www.yarn.com/products/plymouth-yarn-f013-dreambaby-dk-baby-squares-afghan-free">
                Dream Baby Squares Afghan
            </a>. The original pattern calls for size 7 needles while I used
            size 2 needles in the round. I did not adjust the pattern size however this did begin my
            curiosity on how to calculate adjustments to a pattern based on either neede size or yarn weight.
